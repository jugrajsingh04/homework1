What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?
merge is used to merge two different commits that worked in same file as distinct works. that way the work can be identified from the commit it came from. On the other hand, rebase is used to combine multiple commits from before into the new one. so the latest commit will have everything from before and new addition as one.
